Dispersal Analysis

We analyzed the dispersal patterns of 45 weaned elephant seal pups and compared them to adult females and simulated particle tracks representing ocean currents. 

Comparison of Bearings

Watson's Two-Sample Test of Homogeneity revealed significant differences in bearing distributions between weaners and adult females (Test Statistic: 4.4278, p < 0.001), as well as between weaners and surface particles (Test Statistic: 2.5943, p < 0.001). The mean bearing for weaners was 111.808° (SD = 1.408°), compared to 122.428° (SD = 1.812°) for adult females and 114.676° (SD = 1.209°) for surface particles.

When analyzing summarized bearings by individual, the differences remained significant but less pronounced. The mean bearing for weaners was 119.944° (SD = 0.969°), compared to 138.488° (SD = 1.227°) for adult females (Test Statistic: 0.221, 0.01 < p < 0.05) and 114.822° (SD = 0.629°) for surface particles (Test Statistic: 0.1768, 0.05 < p < 0.10).

Current Following Behavior

Of the 45 seals analyzed, 29 (64.4%) were classified as "following" the prevailing currents, with their mean bearings within 45 degrees of the overall particle mean bearing. The angular difference between seal and particle bearings varied over time and among individuals, with some seals showing consistent alignment with currents and others diverging.

Survival Analysis
Overall, 29 out of 45 seals (64.4%) survived their first trip, while 17 out of 45 (37.8%) 
survived their first year.

First-trip Survival

For first-trip survival, the model selection process identified 11 top models with ΔAICc < 2. The best-fitting model included the predictors 'is_following' and 'slope'. Variable importance analysis revealed that 'is_following' (0.57), slope (0.45), and sea surface temperature gradient (SSTgrad) (0.44) were the most important predictors of first-trip survival.

The model-averaged results showed a positive effect of following currents on survival (estimate = 1.021, SE = 0.861), although this effect was not statistically significant at the 0.05 level (p = 0.242). Slope also showed a positive relationship with survival (estimate = 0.465, SE = 0.820, p = 0.575).

First-year Survival

For first-year survival, the model selection process identified 26 models with ΔAICc < 2, indicating substantial model uncertainty. The top model included slope, sea surface height anomaly (SSHA), and eddy kinetic energy (EKE) as predictors.

Variable importance analysis for first-year survival showed that weaning mass (0.77), 'is_following' (0.57), and SSHA (0.56) were the most important predictors, followed by slope (0.39) and chlorophyll gradient (0.38).

The model-averaged results for first-year survival indicated a positive effect of weaning mass (estimate = 0.022, SE = 0.012, p = 0.074) and following currents (estimate = 1.589, SE = 0.946, p = 0.093) on survival, although these effects were marginally significant.

Model Diagnostics

DHARMa model checking did not reveal any significant issues with model fit, such as overdispersion or zero-inflation, for either the first-trip or first-year survival models.

Overall, these results suggest that both oceanographic factors and the tendency to follow currents play important roles in the dispersal and survival of weaned elephant seal pups, with different factors influencing survival over different time scales. The analysis highlights the complex interplay between individual behavior, environmental conditions, and survival outcomes in this species.
