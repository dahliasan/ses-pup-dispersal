Discussion
Juvenile survival is a key determinant of population trajectory, particularly in long-lived slowly reproducing species like elephant seals (Clive R. McMahon et al., 2005). We investigated the foraging movement of naïve, newly weaned elephant seal pups and related this to ocean currents and their subsequent survival. We found that travelling with the flow of predominant currents and being heavier at weaning are important factors that improve first-year survival rates. Additionally, dispersal direction from the colony was different between weaned pups and adult females, suggesting that dispersal behaviours change over time and with experience. In other words, seals can manage their maiden trip with minimal information that is either inherited or learned. This is because simply going with the flow gets them to areas which improve their odds of survival. 

Dispersal direction and survival of weaned pups
Weaned pups travelling within the predominant east-southeast current demonstrated greater survival rate in their first trip and first year survival compared to those moving westward against it. This observation contrasts with findings on Kerguelen juveniles, which showed no difference in survival based on dispersal direction (Cox et al., 2020). The disparity may stem from differences in how "following the current" was defined between the two studies. In Cox et al. 2020, seals were considered to be following the current if they travelled southeast within a 90-degree range. Our study employed a more precise method, using individual corresponding particle traces to determine current alignment.
Previous studies have shown that southern elephant seal pups from Macquarie Island (McConnell et al., 2002; van den Hoff, 2002) and the Kerguelen Islands (Orgeret et al., 2019; Cox et al., 2020) generally disperse south-eastward from their birthplaces, aligning with the dominant ocean currents flowing west to east in those areas. By contrast, pups from King George Island (South Shetland Islands) predominantly travel south-westward from their colonies (Bornemann et al., 2000). Meanwhile, pups from Marion Island exhibit no fixed dispersal directions (McIntyre et al., 2023). These varied patterns could be attributed to the distinct bathymetric and hydrological characteristics surrounding each colony. For example, the region around King George Island is a lot closer to Antarctica and is less open compared to the other colonies (Bornemann et al., 2000). By contrast, Marion Island pups may be more influenced by smaller scale currents and frontal structures than larger ocean currents like the eastward flowing ACC (McIntyre et al., 2023). 
The seal tracks diverging from the particle trace during their foraging journey indicate that they are not merely drifting with the current. Instead, it appears while weaned pups swim without a set destination, they are influenced by the dominant ACC, steering them primarily south-eastward. As they travel, young seals may make subtle directional shifts (Painter and Hillen, 2015) based on cues such as temperature gradients, currents, topography and olfactory signals produced by dimethyl sulphide from phytoplankton (Matsumura et al., 2011; Tosh et al., 2012; Luschi, 2013; Mattern et al., 2013). Nonetheless, the prevailing current ensures a consistent south-easterly trajectory. Seals that deviate from this general behaviour might be influenced by specific environmental or behavioural factors that counteract the current’s influence. However, it is interesting to question why these factors would result in poorer survival. 

Oceanic currents as a passive transport mechanism 
In the first weeks of life, southern elephant seal pups are least experienced and rely heavily on the energy stores given to them by their mothers (Bryden, 1968). Swimming consumes a lot of energy for mammals (Williams et al., 2000; Miller et al., 2012). Therefore, swimming with the flow of dominant ocean currents initially benefits the pups; it allows them to passively cover greater distances (Weimerskirch et al., 2000; Lea et al., 2009). It is especially advantageous for bigger weaned pups, that have greater energy reserves, allowing them more time, up to 10 days extra, to find food before their stores are depleted (McMahon, Burton and Bester, 2000). However, it is important to consider that swimming downstream is a short-term advantage. To return to their colonies, the pups eventually must swim against these currents, which could negate some of the energy they initially saved.

Passive transportation downstream provides pups with two potential benefits. Firstly, it helps them move quickly away from areas near their colonies where predators like sharks and killer whales are likely to be found, thus reducing their risk of predation (Horning and Mellish, 2012; Cox et al., 2020; Henderson et al., 2020). Secondly, it facilitates opportunistic exploration across diverse oceanic regions where they can discover and exploit prey patches (Field et al., 2005). The natural flow of currents can inadvertently steer seals towards zones where convergent surface currents result in the concentration of prey. For example, female southern elephant seals from Kerguelen typically swim downstream, to the east of the island, where they come across a greater number of eddies (Green et al., 2020). Similarly, Marion Island adult females also preferentially swim through areas with high eddy activity (Massie et al., 2016). These oceanic features play a role in clustering prey into denser aggregations, vital for seals and other apex marine predators during their foraging excursions (Cotte et al., 2015; Oliver et al., 2019; Green et al., 2020; Fahlbusch et al., 2022). In contrast, juveniles that forage in areas with weak eddy activity face higher chances of mortality (Cox et al., 2020). Observations of dispersal patterns among different southern elephant seal colonies suggest that the downstream-upstream (east-west) variation in prey distribution could be a widespread feature surrounding Southern Ocean islands.

Additionally, while other factors such as predator abundance (e.g., killer whales) could influence survival, these factors are also impacted by the same ocean currents. Predators tend to follow their prey, which are often concentrated by currents (Sergi et al., 2020). Therefore, the correlation between dispersal direction and survival is not merely a direct relationship but is intertwined with the broader marine ecosystem dynamics shaped by ocean currents. This reinforces the fundamental role of currents in determining survival outcomes, making them a critical component of our study.

Differences in pups and adult females dispersal

We used different tracking technologies for weaners (all Argos) and adult females (30% Argos, 70% GLS). Despite the greater location uncertainty associated with GLS, our analysis of dispersal patterns remains robust. If location uncertainty were obscuring differences between the two groups, we would expect to see a wider, less distinct arc of travel directions for adult females. Instead, we observed a clear southerly trend in female direction data, distinct from the weaned seals' patterns. This indicates that location uncertainty did not unduly affect the overall trends in travel direction, supporting the validity of our comparative analysis.

Given their physiological and size constraints, younger seals do not travel as far as older seals on their foraging trips (Irvine et al., 2000; Field et al., 2005). However, with the assistance of downstream currents, they can effectively navigate through the polar frontal zone to eddy-rich areas (McConnell, Chambers and Fedak, 1992; Bailleul, Cotté and Guinet, 2010). Notably, a yearling managed to cover approximately 5200 km eastwards from Macquarie Island to Peter the First Island, likely aided by downstream swimming (Hindell and Mcmahon, 2000).

Adult female seals display dispersal patterns that diverge significantly from those of weaned pups. This distinction indicates that ocean currents may initially lead young seals to adequate foraging areas, yet these areas may not be the most advantageous. The final choice of foraging habitat is the result of a complex interplay between life history strategies, environmental conditions, and predation risks, rather than just body size or energy maximisation (Hindell et al., 2021). In the critical early stages of life, seal pups develop essential diving and foraging skills (Zeppelin et al., 2019) that are crucial for their long-term survival (Baylis et al., 2005). As they learn from experience, their random movements become more refined and directed, enabling them to reach more optimal foraging areas. This is shown by the behaviour of experienced adult females, which tend to travel more directly and further south towards Antarctic waters (Field et al., 2005; Hindell et al., 2017) that are more productive (Thomalla et al., 2023). As seals mature, they are likely to discover superior foraging grounds to which they develop a strong fidelity (Bradshaw et al., 2004; Authier et al., 2012; Robinson et al., 2012). 

Body weight and dispersal effects on juvenile survival
Body weight at weaning is a key factor in the survival rates of juvenile seals. However, this relationship is not linear but best described by a quadratic relation, indicating a cost to being either too big or too small (McMahon, Burton and Bester, 2003). Generally, heavier weaned pups are more likely to survive their first year (McMahon, Burton and Bester, 2000; Oosthuizen et al., 2018). But weight alone does not guarantee survival. For example, some lighter seals that swam with the current also survived their first year. To illustrate the unpredictable nature of survival, consider two contrasting cases. One seal (mq1-17217-95), despite being the lightest, survived its first year, while another (mq4-cleo-00), being the heaviest, died during its first foraging trip, possibly due to predation. These varied outcomes, even under similar conditions, suggest that survival is a complex interplay between predictable ('deterministic') and unpredictable ('stochastic') factors.

Conclusion
Newly weaned elephant seals, with no prior knowledge of their environment move in accordance with the predominant current flow (likely carried “passively”) while they learn about where and how to forage effectively. By contrast the adult female foraging areas are the consequence of knowledge accumulated over their lifetime. As these juvenile seals become more seasoned, they begin to intentionally navigate away from the current towards chosen foraging destinations. Investigating the impact of the primary eastward current in the sub-Antarctic on the circumpolar patterns of movement for southern elephant seals, and perhaps other marine predators, could broaden our comprehension of Southern Ocean ecology. The innate dispersal behavior of newly independent young and its impact on survival is highly relevant to many species, particularly those that rely on environmental cues during early life stages. Studying young individuals is crucial for understanding population dynamics and survival strategies across species. By examining these mechanisms in seal pups, our findings can provide valuable insights into the survival and behavior of other species facing similar ecological challenges.
