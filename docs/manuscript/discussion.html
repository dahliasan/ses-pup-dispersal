<p>Discussion</p>
<p>Juvenile survival is a key determinant of population trajectory, particularly in K-selected species like southern elephant seals. These species are characterised by long lifespans, delayed maturity, and high parental investment in relatively few offspring - typically one pup per year for elephant seals. Our study investigated the foraging movement of naïve, newly weaned elephant seal pups in relation to ocean currents, environmental variables, and their subsequent survival. We found that travelling with the flow of predominant currents, being heavier at weaning, and encountering favourable environmental conditions are important factors that improve first trip and first year survival rates.</p>
<p>Dispersal direction and survival of weaned pups</p>
<p>Weaned pups travelling within the predominant east-southeast current demonstrated greater survival rate in their first trip and first year compared to those moving westward against it. This observation contrasts with findings on Kerguelen juveniles, which showed no difference in survival based on dispersal direction (Cox et al., 2020). The disparity may stem from differences in how “following the current” was defined between the two studies. In Cox et al.&nbsp;2020, seals were considered to be following the current if they travelled southeast within a broad 90-degree range. Our study used a more precise method, using individual corresponding particle traces to determine current alignment.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that southern elephant seal pups from Macquarie Island (McConnell et al., 2002; van den Hoff, 2002) and the Kerguelen Islands (Orgeret et al., 2019; Cox et al., 2020) generally disperse south-eastward from their birthplaces, aligning with the dominant ocean currents flowing west to east in those areas. By contrast, pups from King George Island (South Shetland Islands) predominantly travel south-westward from their colonies (Bornemann et al., 2000). Meanwhile, pups from Marion Island exhibit no fixed dispersal directions (McIntyre et al., 2023). These varied patterns could be attributed to the distinct bathymetric and hydrological characteristics surrounding each colony. For example, the region around King George Island is a lot closer to Antarctica and is less open compared to the other colonies (Bornemann et al., 2000). By contrast, Marion Island pups may be more influenced by smaller scale currents and frontal structures than larger ocean currents like the eastward flowing ACC (McIntyre et al., 2023).</p>
<p>The seal tracks diverging from the particle trace during their foraging journey indicate that they are not merely drifting with the current. Instead, it appears while weaned pups swim without a set destination, they are influenced by the dominant ACC, steering them primarily south-eastward. Our results show that weaned pups tend to follow currents more closely in the early part of their first trip, gradually deviating from this pattern as time progresses. This suggests a learning process where pups initially rely heavily on passive transport before developing more active foraging strategies. As they travel, young seals may make subtle directional shifts (Painter and Hillen, 2015) based on cues such as temperature gradients, currents, topography and olfactory signals produced by dimethyl sulphide from phytoplankton (Matsumura et al., 2011; Tosh et al., 2012; Luschi, 2013; Mattern et al., 2013). Nonetheless, the prevailing current ensures a consistent south-easterly trajectory. Seals that deviate from this general behaviour might be influenced by specific environmental or behavioural factors that counteract the current’s influence. However, it is interesting to question why these factors would result in poorer survival.</p>
<p>Oceanic currents as a passive transport mechanism</p>
<p>In the first weeks of life, southern elephant seal pups are least experienced and rely heavily on the energy stores given to them by their mothers (Bryden, 1968). Swimming consumes a lot of energy for mammals (Williams et al., 2000; Miller et al., 2012). Therefore, swimming with the flow of dominant ocean currents initially benefits the pups; it allows them to passively cover greater distances (Weimerskirch et al., 2000; Lea et al., 2009). This passive transportation provides two potential benefits: reducing predation risk by quickly moving away from areas near their colonies where predators are likely to be found, and facilitating opportunistic exploration across diverse oceanic regions where they can discover and exploit prey patches.</p>
<p>It is especially advantageous for bigger weaned pups with greater energy reserves, allowing them more time (up to 10 days extra) to find food before their stores are depleted (McMahon, Burton and Bester, 2000). However, it’s important to note that swimming downstream is not without potential costs. Pups must eventually swim against these currents to return to their colonies, which could negate some of the energy initially saved. Despite this energy expenditure during the return journey, our results show that following currents still leads to better overall survival rates. This suggests that the benefits of initial passive transport, such as reduced predation risk and increased foraging opportunities, outweigh the later energy costs of returning against the current. The net positive effect on survival underscores the importance of this behavior for juvenile seals.</p>
<p>Additionally, while other factors such as predator abundance (e.g., killer whales) could influence survival, these factors are also impacted by the same ocean currents. Predators tend to follow their prey, which are often concentrated by currents (Sergi et al., 2020). Therefore, the correlation between dispersal direction and survival is not merely a direct relationship but is intertwined with the broader marine ecosystem dynamics shaped by ocean currents.</p>
<p>Impact of environmental factors on survival</p>
<p>Our logistic modeling revealed that environmental variables such as sea surface height anomaly (SSHA), slope, and eddy kinetic energy (EKE) play significant roles in juvenile survival. These factors likely influence the availability and distribution of prey, as well as the energetic costs associated with foraging. Higher SSHA values may indicate the presence of warm-core eddies, which can enhance primary productivity and concentrate prey species. Steeper slope regions are often associated with upwelling and increased nutrient availability, supporting richer food webs. Elevated EKE reflects areas of dynamic ocean currents and turbulence, which can aggregate prey and create profitable foraging grounds.</p>
<p>The natural flow of currents can inadvertently steer seals towards zones where convergent surface currents result in the concentration of prey. For example, female southern elephant seals from Kerguelen typically swim downstream, to the east of the island, where they encounter a greater number of eddies (Green et al., 2020). Similarly, Marion Island adult females also preferentially swim through areas with high eddy activity (Massie et al., 2016). These oceanic features play a role in clustering prey into denser aggregations, vital for seals and other apex marine predators during their foraging excursions (Cotte et al., 2015; Oliver et al., 2019; Green et al., 2020; Fahlbusch et al., 2022).</p>
<p>Juvenile seals navigating through these favorable environments are likely to encounter abundant food resources, improving their energy intake and survival prospects. Conversely, juveniles that forage in areas with weak eddy activity face higher chances of mortality (Cox et al., 2020). This reinforces the fundamental role of currents and associated environmental features in determining survival outcomes, making them critical components of our study.</p>
<p>Differences in pups and adult females dispersal</p>
<p>We used different tracking technologies for weaners (all Argos) and adult females (30% Argos, 70% GLS). Despite the greater location uncertainty associated with GLS, our analysis of dispersal patterns remains robust. If location uncertainty were obscuring differences between the two groups, we would expect to see a wider, less distinct arc of travel directions for adult females. Instead, we observed a clear southerly trend in female direction data, distinct from the weaned seals’ patterns. This indicates that location uncertainty did not unduly affect the overall trends in travel direction, supporting the validity of our comparative analysis.</p>
<p>Given their physiological and size constraints, younger seals do not travel as far as older seals on their foraging trips (Irvine et al., 2000; Field et al., 2005). However, with the assistance of downstream currents, they can effectively navigate through the polar frontal zone to eddy-rich areas (McConnell, Chambers and Fedak, 1992; Bailleul, Cotté and Guinet, 2010). Notably, a yearling managed to cover approximately 5200 km eastwards from Macquarie Island to Peter the First Island, likely aided by downstream swimming (Hindell and Mcmahon, 2000).</p>
<p>Adult female seals display dispersal patterns that diverge significantly from those of weaned pups. This distinction indicates that ocean currents may initially lead young seals to adequate foraging areas, yet these areas may not be the most advantageous. The final choice of foraging habitat is the result of a complex interplay between life history strategies, environmental conditions, and predation risks, rather than just body size or energy maximisation (Hindell et al., 2021). In the critical early stages of life, seal pups develop essential diving and foraging skills (Zeppelin et al., 2019) that are crucial for their long-term survival (Baylis et al., 2005). As they learn from experience, their random movements become more refined and directed, enabling them to reach more optimal foraging areas. This is shown by the behaviour of experienced adult females, which tend to travel more directly and further south towards Antarctic waters (Field et al., 2005; Hindell et al., 2017) that are more productive (Thomalla et al., 2023). As seals mature, they are likely to discover superior foraging grounds to which they develop a strong fidelity (Bradshaw et al., 2004; Authier et al., 2012; Robinson et al., 2012).</p>
<p>Body weight and dispersal effects on juvenile survival</p>
<p>Body weight at weaning is a key factor in the survival rates of juvenile seals. However, this relationship is not linear but best described by a quadratic relation, indicating a cost to being either too big or too small (McMahon, Burton and Bester, 2003). Generally, heavier weaned pups are more likely to survive their first year (McMahon, Burton and Bester, 2000; Oosthuizen et al., 2018). But weight alone does not guarantee survival, as demonstrated by the varied outcomes in our study.</p>
<p>These findings highlight that survival is a complex interplay of intrinsic factors, such as body condition, and extrinsic environmental conditions. The significant role of environmental variables in our models indicates that favorable oceanographic conditions can enhance the survival prospects of juveniles, regardless of their weaning mass. Therefore, even lighter pups may improve their chances of survival by dispersing into areas with optimal environmental conditions that support abundant prey availability.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Newly weaned elephant seals, with no prior knowledge of their environment, move in accordance with the predominant current flow while they learn about where and how to forage effectively. This behavior, coupled with favorable environmental conditions, significantly influences their survival prospects. As these juvenile seals become more seasoned, they begin to intentionally navigate away from the current towards chosen foraging destinations, as evidenced by the different dispersal patterns of adult females.</p>
<p>Investigating the impact of the primary eastward current in the sub-Antarctic on the circumpolar patterns of movement for southern elephant seals, and perhaps other marine predators, could broaden our comprehension of Southern Ocean ecology. The innate dispersal behavior of newly independent young and its impact on survival is highly relevant to many species, particularly those that rely on environmental cues during early life stages. By examining these mechanisms in seal pups, our findings provide valuable insights into the survival and behavior of other species facing similar ecological challenges in marine environments.</p>

<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Juvenile survival is a key determinant of population trajectory, particularly in K-selected species like southern elephant seals. These species are characterised by long lifespans, delayed maturity, and high parental investment in relatively few offspring - typically one pup per year for elephant seals. Our study investigated the foraging movement of naïve, newly weaned elephant seal pups in relation to ocean currents, environmental variables, and their subsequent survival. We found that travelling with the flow of predominant currents, being heavier at weaning, and encountering favourable environmental conditions are important factors that improve first trip and first year survival rates.</span>

<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Weaned pups travelling within the predominant east-southeast current demonstrated greater survival rate in their first trip and first year compared to those moving westward against it. This observation contrasts with findings on Kerguelen juveniles, which showed no difference in survival based on dispersal direction (Cox et al., 2020). The disparity may stem from differences in how "following the current" was defined between the two studies. In Cox et al. 2020, seals were considered to be following the current if they travelled southeast within a broad 90-degree range. Our study used a more precise method, using individual corresponding particle traces to determine current alignment.</span>
<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-9"><a href="#cb1-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Previous studies have shown that southern elephant seal pups from Macquarie Island (McConnell et al., 2002; van den Hoff, 2002) and the Kerguelen Islands (Orgeret et al., 2019; Cox et al., 2020) generally disperse south-eastward from their birthplaces, aligning with the dominant ocean currents flowing west to east in those areas. By contrast, pups from King George Island (South Shetland Islands) predominantly travel south-westward from their colonies (Bornemann et al., 2000). Meanwhile, pups from Marion Island exhibit no fixed dispersal directions (McIntyre et al., 2023). These varied patterns could be attributed to the distinct bathymetric and hydrological characteristics surrounding each colony. For example, the region around King George Island is a lot closer to Antarctica and is less open compared to the other colonies (Bornemann et al., 2000). By contrast, Marion Island pups may be more influenced by smaller scale currents and frontal structures than larger ocean currents like the eastward flowing ACC (McIntyre et al., 2023).</span>
<span id="cb1-10"><a href="#cb1-10" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-11"><a href="#cb1-11" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The seal tracks diverging from the particle trace during their foraging journey indicate that they are not merely drifting with the current. Instead, it appears while weaned pups swim without a set destination, they are influenced by the dominant ACC, steering them primarily south-eastward. Our results show that weaned pups tend to follow currents more closely in the early part of their first trip, gradually deviating from this pattern as time progresses. This suggests a learning process where pups initially rely heavily on passive transport before developing more active foraging strategies. As they travel, young seals may make subtle directional shifts (Painter and Hillen, 2015) based on cues such as temperature gradients, currents, topography and olfactory signals produced by dimethyl sulphide from phytoplankton (Matsumura et al., 2011; Tosh et al., 2012; Luschi, 2013; Mattern et al., 2013). Nonetheless, the prevailing current ensures a consistent south-easterly trajectory. Seals that deviate from this general behaviour might be influenced by specific environmental or behavioural factors that counteract the current's influence. However, it is interesting to question why these factors would result in poorer survival.</span>

<span id="cb1-14"><a href="#cb1-14" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-15"><a href="#cb1-15" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In the first weeks of life, southern elephant seal pups are least experienced and rely heavily on the energy stores given to them by their mothers (Bryden, 1968). Swimming consumes a lot of energy for mammals (Williams et al., 2000; Miller et al., 2012). Therefore, swimming with the flow of dominant ocean currents initially benefits the pups; it allows them to passively cover greater distances (Weimerskirch et al., 2000; Lea et al., 2009). This passive transportation provides two potential benefits: reducing predation risk by quickly moving away from areas near their colonies where predators are likely to be found, and facilitating opportunistic exploration across diverse oceanic regions where they can discover and exploit prey patches.</span>
<span id="cb1-16"><a href="#cb1-16" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-17"><a href="#cb1-17" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>It is especially advantageous for bigger weaned pups with greater energy reserves, allowing them more time (up to 10 days extra) to find food before their stores are depleted (McMahon, Burton and Bester, 2000). However, it's important to note that swimming downstream is not without potential costs. Pups must eventually swim against these currents to return to their colonies, which could negate some of the energy initially saved. Despite this energy expenditure during the return journey, our results show that following currents still leads to better overall survival rates. This suggests that the benefits of initial passive transport, such as reduced predation risk and increased foraging opportunities, outweigh the later energy costs of returning against the current. The net positive effect on survival underscores the importance of this behavior for juvenile seals.</span>
<span id="cb1-18"><a href="#cb1-18" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-19"><a href="#cb1-19" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Additionally, while other factors such as predator abundance (e.g., killer whales) could influence survival, these factors are also impacted by the same ocean currents. Predators tend to follow their prey, which are often concentrated by currents (Sergi et al., 2020). Therefore, the correlation between dispersal direction and survival is not merely a direct relationship but is intertwined with the broader marine ecosystem dynamics shaped by ocean currents.</span>

<span id="cb1-22"><a href="#cb1-22" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-23"><a href="#cb1-23" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Our logistic modeling revealed that environmental variables such as sea surface height anomaly (SSHA), slope, and eddy kinetic energy (EKE) play significant roles in juvenile survival. These factors likely influence the availability and distribution of prey, as well as the energetic costs associated with foraging. Higher SSHA values may indicate the presence of warm-core eddies, which can enhance primary productivity and concentrate prey species. Steeper slope regions are often associated with upwelling and increased nutrient availability, supporting richer food webs. Elevated EKE reflects areas of dynamic ocean currents and turbulence, which can aggregate prey and create profitable foraging grounds.</span>
<span id="cb1-24"><a href="#cb1-24" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-25"><a href="#cb1-25" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The natural flow of currents can inadvertently steer seals towards zones where convergent surface currents result in the concentration of prey. For example, female southern elephant seals from Kerguelen typically swim downstream, to the east of the island, where they encounter a greater number of eddies (Green et al., 2020). Similarly, Marion Island adult females also preferentially swim through areas with high eddy activity (Massie et al., 2016). These oceanic features play a role in clustering prey into denser aggregations, vital for seals and other apex marine predators during their foraging excursions (Cotte et al., 2015; Oliver et al., 2019; Green et al., 2020; Fahlbusch et al., 2022).</span>
<span id="cb1-26"><a href="#cb1-26" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-27"><a href="#cb1-27" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Juvenile seals navigating through these favorable environments are likely to encounter abundant food resources, improving their energy intake and survival prospects. Conversely, juveniles that forage in areas with weak eddy activity face higher chances of mortality (Cox et al., 2020). This reinforces the fundamental role of currents and associated environmental features in determining survival outcomes, making them critical components of our study.</span>

<span id="cb1-30"><a href="#cb1-30" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-31"><a href="#cb1-31" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>We used different tracking technologies for weaners (all Argos) and adult females (30% Argos, 70% GLS). Despite the greater location uncertainty associated with GLS, our analysis of dispersal patterns remains robust. If location uncertainty were obscuring differences between the two groups, we would expect to see a wider, less distinct arc of travel directions for adult females. Instead, we observed a clear southerly trend in female direction data, distinct from the weaned seals' patterns. This indicates that location uncertainty did not unduly affect the overall trends in travel direction, supporting the validity of our comparative analysis.</span>
<span id="cb1-32"><a href="#cb1-32" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-33"><a href="#cb1-33" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Given their physiological and size constraints, younger seals do not travel as far as older seals on their foraging trips (Irvine et al., 2000; Field et al., 2005). However, with the assistance of downstream currents, they can effectively navigate through the polar frontal zone to eddy-rich areas (McConnell, Chambers and Fedak, 1992; Bailleul, Cotté and Guinet, 2010). Notably, a yearling managed to cover approximately 5200 km eastwards from Macquarie Island to Peter the First Island, likely aided by downstream swimming (Hindell and Mcmahon, 2000).</span>
<span id="cb1-34"><a href="#cb1-34" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-35"><a href="#cb1-35" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Adult female seals display dispersal patterns that diverge significantly from those of weaned pups. This distinction indicates that ocean currents may initially lead young seals to adequate foraging areas, yet these areas may not be the most advantageous. The final choice of foraging habitat is the result of a complex interplay between life history strategies, environmental conditions, and predation risks, rather than just body size or energy maximisation (Hindell et al., 2021). In the critical early stages of life, seal pups develop essential diving and foraging skills (Zeppelin et al., 2019) that are crucial for their long-term survival (Baylis et al., 2005). As they learn from experience, their random movements become more refined and directed, enabling them to reach more optimal foraging areas. This is shown by the behaviour of experienced adult females, which tend to travel more directly and further south towards Antarctic waters (Field et al., 2005; Hindell et al., 2017) that are more productive (Thomalla et al., 2023). As seals mature, they are likely to discover superior foraging grounds to which they develop a strong fidelity (Bradshaw et al., 2004; Authier et al., 2012; Robinson et al., 2012).</span>

<span id="cb1-38"><a href="#cb1-38" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-39"><a href="#cb1-39" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Body weight at weaning is a key factor in the survival rates of juvenile seals. However, this relationship is not linear but best described by a quadratic relation, indicating a cost to being either too big or too small (McMahon, Burton and Bester, 2003). Generally, heavier weaned pups are more likely to survive their first year (McMahon, Burton and Bester, 2000; Oosthuizen et al., 2018). But weight alone does not guarantee survival, as demonstrated by the varied outcomes in our study.</span>
<span id="cb1-40"><a href="#cb1-40" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-41"><a href="#cb1-41" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>These findings highlight that survival is a complex interplay of intrinsic factors, such as body condition, and extrinsic environmental conditions. The significant role of environmental variables in our models indicates that favorable oceanographic conditions can enhance the survival prospects of juveniles, regardless of their weaning mass. Therefore, even lighter pups may improve their chances of survival by dispersing into areas with optimal environmental conditions that support abundant prey availability.</span>

<span id="cb1-44"><a href="#cb1-44" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-45"><a href="#cb1-45" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Newly weaned elephant seals, with no prior knowledge of their environment, move in accordance with the predominant current flow while they learn about where and how to forage effectively. This behavior, coupled with favorable environmental conditions, significantly influences their survival prospects. As these juvenile seals become more seasoned, they begin to intentionally navigate away from the current towards chosen foraging destinations, as evidenced by the different dispersal patterns of adult females.</span>
<span id="cb1-46"><a href="#cb1-46" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-47"><a href="#cb1-47" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Investigating the impact of the primary eastward current in the sub-Antarctic on the circumpolar patterns of movement for southern elephant seals, and perhaps other marine predators, could broaden our comprehension of Southern Ocean ecology. The innate dispersal behavior of newly independent young and its impact on survival is highly relevant to many species, particularly those that rely on environmental cues during early life stages. By examining these mechanisms in seal pups, our findings provide valuable insights into the survival and behavior of other species facing similar ecological challenges in marine environments.</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
